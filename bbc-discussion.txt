a) Precision metric would be best suited for this dataset because of how accurate the data 
is represented. Since the dataset is mostly evenly distributed, the F1 measure wouldn't be too impactful. 


b) The performance of steps (8-10) is better than those of step 7 because by changing the smoothing values, it reduces the noise inputs and gives a more accurate representation of the dataset. By comparing the smoothing value of 0.9 and 0.0001, we can see that the smoothing of 0.0001 runs better because it returns a better precision, recall and F1-score.
